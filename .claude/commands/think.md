# Think

Deep analysis and multi-dimensional problem solving mode.

**Challenge:** $ARGUMENTS

## Deep Thinking Protocol

This command provides comprehensive analysis from multiple perspectives:

### 1. Parse the Problem

- Extract the core challenge from the provided context
- Identify all stakeholders and constraints
- Recognize implicit requirements and hidden complexities
- Question assumptions and surface unknowns

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Technical Perspective:**

- Analyze technical feasibility and constraints
- Consider scalability, performance, and maintainability
- Evaluate security implications
- Assess technical debt and future-proofing

**Business Perspective:**

- Understand business value and ROI
- Consider competitive advantages
- Assess risk vs. reward trade-offs

**User Perspective:**

- Analyze user needs and pain points
- Consider usability and accessibility
- Evaluate user experience implications
- Think about edge cases and user journeys

**System Perspective:**

- Consider system-wide impacts
- Analyze integration points
- Evaluate dependencies and coupling
- Think about emergent behaviors

**Architecture Perspective** (using mcp__zen__analyze):

- System design and structure
- Component relationships
- Design patterns and best practices
- API design and data flow

### 3. Generate Multiple Solutions

Brainstorm 3-5 different approaches:

- Pros and cons for each
- Implementation complexity
- Resource requirements
- Potential risks
- Long-term implications
- Include both conventional and creative solutions
- Consider hybrid approaches

### 4. Deep Dive Analysis

For the most promising solutions:

- Create detailed implementation plans
- Identify potential pitfalls and mitigation strategies
- Consider phased approaches and MVPs
- Analyze second and third-order effects
- Think through failure modes and recovery

### 5. Cross-Domain Thinking

- Draw parallels from other industries or domains
- Apply design patterns from different contexts
- Consider biological or natural system analogies
- Look for innovative combinations

### 6. Challenge and Refine

- Play devil's advocate with each solution
- Identify weaknesses and blind spots
- Consider "what if" scenarios
- Stress-test assumptions
- Look for unintended consequences

### 7. Synthesize Insights

- Combine insights from all perspectives
- Identify key decision factors
- Highlight critical trade-offs
- Summarize innovative discoveries
- Present a nuanced view of the problem space

## What This Includes

This command consolidates:

- ~~`/ultra-think`~~ - Deep analysis (now here)
- ~~`/quality:analyze`~~ - Comprehensive analysis (now integrated)

## Analysis Modes

**Quick Assessment** (5-10 min):

- High-level architecture
- Technology stack evaluation

## Tools Available

- **Analysis**: mcp__zen__analyze (architecture, performance, security, quality)
- **Exploration**: Task(subagent_type='Explore')
- **Metrics**: Bash (git, code analysis)
- **Research**: WebSearch, mcp__zen__apilookup

## Example Usage

```bash
# Architectural decision
/think Should we migrate to microservices or improve our monolith?

# Technology selection
/think What state management solution should we use for our React app?

# System design
/think How do we scale to handle 10x traffic while reducing costs?

# Problem solving
/think How can we improve API backward compatibility while modernizing?

# Code quality
/think "Analyze the authentication system architecture"

# Performance
/think "Why is the dashboard slow and how can we fix it?"
```

## Output Expectations

- Comprehensive analysis (typically 2-4 pages)
- Multiple viable solutions with trade-offs
- Clear reasoning chains
- Acknowledgment of uncertainties
- Actionable recommendations
- Novel insights or perspectives

Remember: Deep thinking finds not just solutions, but the RIGHT solution considering all constraints.
